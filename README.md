# Windows-UI-Settings-Troubleshooting
A user wants to enable Dark Mode on their Windows 11 computer for better visibility and to reduce eye strain, but they are unsure how to change this setting.

Sample Questions to Ask the End User:

Are you wanting to enable Dark Mode for all apps and system menus, or just specific applications?
Do you have any custom themes or settings applied that may override system settings?
Are you experiencing any specific issues (like visibility problems) in Light Mode?
Would you like to schedule Dark Mode to switch automatically between Light and Dark based on the time of day?
Have you tried accessing the Settings app to change the theme before, and did you encounter any difficulties?
